    "Our goal is to classify an input image into one of the 10 classes of clothing, so we will define our neural network to take as input a matrix of shape (28, 28) and output a vector of size 10, where the index of the largest value in the output corresponds to the integer label for the class of clothing in the image. For example, if we use an image of an ankle boot as input, we might get an output vector $y'$ like this:\n",

    "The [`Flatten`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Flatten) layer turns our input matrix of shape (28, 28) into a vector of size 728. The [`Dense`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dense) layers are also known as \"fully connected\" or \"linear\" layers because they connect all nodes from the previous layer with each of their own nodes using a linear function. Notice that they specify \"ReLU\" as the activation &mdash; that's because we want the results of the linear mathematical operation to get passed as input to a \"Rectified Linear Unit\" function, which adds non-linearity to the calculations. Finally, [`Sequential`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Sequential) combines all the other layers into a model.\n",
