The true power of a neural network is its ability to make predictions for data that has not been seen during training or testing. But for the sake of simplicity, we'll demonstrate how prediction works by re-using a few of the images that we used during testing. The code below retrieves the first three images in our test data and uses them to make predictions. We then print the actual and predicted labels."
