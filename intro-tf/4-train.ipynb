    "Now that you've learned about tensors, variables, and automatic differentiation, you're ready to learn how to train a neural network using TensorFlow. You've already seen how to train a neural network using Keras in [module 1](../intro-machine-learning-keras) &mdash; in this notebook, we'll re-implement the training loop in TensorFlow. This will help you understand what goes on under the hood a bit better, will give you the opportunity to customize the training loop if you want, and will enable you to debug it.\n",
